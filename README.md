# CountryAppMVVM

## Purpose of the Application
**The purpose of this application is to experience many different libraries and different layout structures. The implementation was made according to MVVM. Libraries and layouts such as Retrofit, RXJava, Room, Glide and Refresh Layout were used in the application. Data is not constantly pulled over the API with Retrofit, but if less time has passed than the specified time interval or if it has not been refreshed, it is pulled from the local database of the device with Room.**
